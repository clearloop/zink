# Benchmarks

This chapter terms to record the benchmarks of zink projects comparing
with `solidity` and `vyper`.

We are not going to compare with `yul` or `huff` since we are on different
level, however, if zink is even faster than `yul` or `huff` in some cases,
don't be suprised, we are born with high performance.
