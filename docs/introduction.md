# Introduction

[Zink][zink] is a powerful toolchain revolutionizing smart contract development 
on Ethereum, it is designed to bridge the gap between WebAssembly and the Ethereum 
Virtual Machine. 

At its core, [zinkc][zinkc], the Zink compiler, **takes WASM bytecode as the source 
code and transforms it into EVM bytecode** for seamless execution on the Ethereum 
blockchain. This optimization ensures efficient and reliable execution of smart 
contracts on Ethereum.
