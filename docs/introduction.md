# Introduction

[Zink][zink] is a powerful toolchain designed to bridge the gap between WebAssembly
(WASM) and the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). At the core of the Zink ecosystem is 
Zinkc, a compiler that takes Wasm bytecode as the source code and transforms it into 
Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode for seamless execution on the Ethereum blockchain.
