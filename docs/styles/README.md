# Style Guide

This style guide is for writing zink projects with `rust` as the
source language.

We don't need any styles for now, just writing anything you want,
and the zinkc compiler will handle the rest of everything.

For the futures plans of `events`, `selector`, `storage` and `...`
plz keep tuned, they will be implemented in [`v0.2.0`][v0.2.0] : )

[v0.2.0]: https://github.com/clearloop/zink/milestone/2
